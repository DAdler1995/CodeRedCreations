                Here at Code Red Creations our goal is to provide the best customer service. 
                This means that we're here to help answer any questions aboutparts, order 
                status, or even navigating out website. We're trying to be as transparent in 
                our ordering process as we possible can be so that we can take the guess work 
                out of ordering online.
